Each player will have same number of chips at the beginning of the game.
During the betting round, you should pay attention how many chips you have.
If you bet the amount more than you have, the system will atomatically let you fold.

For each set:

    1) In Ante, each player is forced to put one chip in pot.

    2) For the first betting round, you can choose bet, fold, check, call, or raise. 

	   Check: If no one has yet opened the betting round, 
	   	  a player may pass or check, which is equivalent 
		  to calling the current bet of zero. 

	   Bet:   you can start betting by bet 2.

       	   Call:  call is to match a bet or match a raise. Call 4 means you will put 4
	   	  chips in pot to remain in.

	   Raise: raise is to increase the size of the bet required to stay in the pot, 
	   	  forcing all subsequent players to call the new amount if they wish 
		  to remain in. Raise n means you raise the amount from n to 2n.

 	   Fold:  to fold is to discard one's hand and forfeit interest in the current pot.
       

    3) For the discarding round, you can discard 0-5 cards, and dealer will give you 
       new cards to ensure you have 5 cards in hand.

    4) For the second betting round, you can choose bet, fold, check, call, or raise.

    5) If you still on the table, you will show your hand, and compare with other players.

    6) The winner will get all the chips in the pot.

The player with chips less than 3 in their hand will be kicked out of the game. The rest 
players will continue playing unitil there is only one player having more than 2 chips. This
player will be final winner.
